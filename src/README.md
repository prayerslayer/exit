# Exit

_You're strolling around in the Louvre, enjoying your time._

**PA System**: Dear visitors, our museum closes in 5 minutes. Please proceed to the exit immediately. Have a nice day.

**You**: Wait, I haven't seen half of the exhibitions here! I'll just hurry up a bit.

_Museum staff gives you a death stare and starts closing doors..._

## TODO

### Mechanics

* Switch map when hitting a door OR figure out this camera
* Fog of War
  * How? Tile engine doesn't support dynamic manipulation apparently
* Visitors moving to doors/paintings
  * A* star pathfinding
* Add tiles for paintings
* Keep score for seen paintings
* Countdown

### Presentation

* Screenshake
* Baseball bat and violence
* Blasting techno? Probably
